## React useMemo Hook:
- The React useMemo Hook returns a memoized value.
- Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.
- The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.
- This can improve performance.

# The main difference between useCallback and useMemo:
- The main difference is that useMemo returns a memoized value and useCallback returns a memoized function.
